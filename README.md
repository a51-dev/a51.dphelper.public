## About üî•

dpHelper is a pricise and complete collection of functions ready to use in all web application. State and Store Management are now easy and global. Just for example **state.myData = "hello world"** and your string is ready everywhere in your Ajax or React app. It's more easy and intuitive of Redux.
You don't need to creare any extra files, dispatch or reducer.

Please, read the [LICENSE](/LICENSE.txt) agreement before to implementing in your application.

## Live demo

[https://a51.dev/tests/](https://a51.dev/tests/)

You can see an HTML version where dpHelper and LayerPro works.
You can use with html, react, vue or any other frontend / library.

## The Best Way To Use State and Store üí•

You can use "state" to store all what you want and reuse everywhere. Like other state manager you can store information in JSON format and you can use them in react, useEffect, dispatch in a very easy way.

_example:_

You can use devtools in your browser and type " **state.test = 'I am ready'** ".
Every time you want to use '**test**' you need just recall **state.test**.

```javascript
state.test = "I am ready";
```

recall

```javascript
state.test
```

To see all states just use

```javascript
state
```

## Observer üòé

If you want to run a funtion everytime a state change you can use:

```javascript
observer("test",()=>alert("Test Changes to: " + state.test))
```

You can use it everywere. Works like "useState" in react but with more flexibility

## State vs Store üéÖ

**INFO**: if you want to use as permanent storage (localStorage) you need to use " **store.** " instead state.
